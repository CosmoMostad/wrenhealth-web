  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

  <p>At Wren Health, your privacy is not a feature — it's the foundation. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. Please read it carefully.</p>

  <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
  <p>Wren Health ("we," "our," or "us") is a health record management application for individuals and families. Our services allow you to store, organize, and share personal health information. We can be reached at <a href="mailto:privacy@wrenhealth.app">privacy@wrenhealth.app</a>.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the information necessary to provide our services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Your name, email address, and password when you create an account.</li>
    <li><strong>Health Profile Data:</strong> Information you voluntarily enter about yourself or family members, including names, dates of birth, blood type, allergies, medications, medical history, insurance information, emergency contacts, and related documents.</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar Data:</strong> Appointment and event information you add to your family health calendar.</li>
    <li><strong>Sharing Information:</strong> Details of any health profile information you choose to share with others through the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic technical data such as device type and operating system version, used solely for providing and improving the service.</li>
    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Aggregate, anonymized data about how features are used, to help us improve the app. This data cannot be tied back to you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your information exclusively to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide, maintain, and improve the Wren Health service</li>
    <li>Send appointment reminders and notifications you've opted into</li>
    <li>Respond to your support requests</li>
    <li>Maintain the security and integrity of your account</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> use your health data for advertising, and we will never sell your personal information to third parties.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Store and Protect Your Data</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored on secure, enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure. We implement industry-standard security measures including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encryption of data in transit (TLS 1.2+) and at rest (AES-256)</li>
    <li>Row-level security policies ensuring you can only access your own data</li>
    <li>Regular security reviews and access controls</li>
    <li>Secure authentication with password hashing</li>
  </ul>
  <p>While we take reasonable measures to protect your information, no system is 100% secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password and enable any available security features.</p>

  <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
  <p>We share your information only in the following circumstances:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>With Your Permission:</strong> When you choose to share a health profile with another person through the app's sharing features, that person will see only the information you've selected to share.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use a small number of trusted third-party providers to operate our infrastructure (such as cloud hosting and email delivery). These providers are contractually prohibited from using your data for any purpose other than providing services to us.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or other legal process, or to protect the safety of any person.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We will never sell, rent, or trade your personal health information to advertisers, insurers, employers, or data brokers.</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  <p>You have the following rights regarding your data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view all information stored in your account at any time within the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> You can edit or correct your information directly in the app.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> You can delete individual health profiles or your entire account at any time. Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.</li>
    <li><strong>Export:</strong> Contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@wrenhealth.app">privacy@wrenhealth.app</a> to request a copy of your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt-Out:</strong> You can disable notifications in the app's Settings at any time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>Wren Health is designed for use by adults (13+) managing health information for themselves and their families. We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13. Health profiles for children are created and managed by a parent or guardian who has accepted this policy.</p>

  <h2>8. Health Information Notice</h2>
  <p>Wren Health is a personal health record tool, not a HIPAA-covered entity. We are not a healthcare provider, and the information you store in Wren Health is not protected by HIPAA. However, we have designed our infrastructure and policies to align with HIPAA best practices because we believe your health information deserves that level of care.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you via email or an in-app notice before the changes take effect. Continued use of Wren Health after changes constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>
