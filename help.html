  <h1>Help & FAQ</h1>
  <p class="updated">Can't find your answer? Email us at <a href="mailto:support@wrenhealth.app">support@wrenhealth.app</a></p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      How do I create my first health profile?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>After signing up, Wren Health will walk you through creating your own health profile first. Enter your name, date of birth, blood type, and any other information you'd like to start with. You can always add more later — your profile is never complete until you want it to be. Once your profile is set up, you can add family members from the My Accounts tab.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      How do I add a family member?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Go to the My Accounts tab and tap "Add Family Member" at the bottom of the screen. Enter their name and any information you know. You can add as many family members as you need — children, parents, grandparents, or anyone else whose health information you manage.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      Is Wren Health free?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Yes — Wren Health is free to download and use. You can create health profiles for yourself and your family members at no cost. We may introduce optional premium features in the future, but core functionality will always remain free.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Health Profiles</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      What information can I store in a health profile?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Each health profile can store: personal info (name, DOB, blood type, gender), allergies (with severity), medications (name, dosage, frequency), medical history and past surgeries, insurance information (carrier, policy number, group number, member ID), emergency contacts, healthcare proxy, primary care doctor, and free-form notes. You can fill in as much or as little as you want.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      Can I edit information after I've saved it?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Yes — all information in a health profile can be edited at any time. Open the profile, find the section you want to update, and tap the pencil icon to edit it. Tap Save when you're done.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      How do I add documents or medical records?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Open a family member's profile and tap the Documents button at the top. You can take a photo or upload a file from your phone. Documents are stored securely and linked to that person's profile. Scan lab results, insurance cards, prescriptions, or any other medical paperwork.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Sharing</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      How do I share a health profile with a doctor or caregiver?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Open the family member's profile and tap the Share button at the top. Enter the recipient's email address and choose which sections to share (e.g., just allergies and medications, or the full profile). You can grant view-only or edit access. The recipient will receive an invitation and can view the shared information within the app.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      Can I revoke access after sharing?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Yes — you can revoke access at any time. Go to the Shared With Me tab, find the shared profile, and remove access. Once revoked, the recipient will no longer be able to view any of the shared information.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      Someone shared a profile with me. How do I access it?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>You'll receive a notification when someone shares a profile with you. Go to the Shared With Me tab to see pending requests. Tap Accept to add the shared profile to your view. You'll only see the sections the owner chose to share with you.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h2>Calendar</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      How do I create a family health calendar?
      <span class="faq-arrow">›</span>
    </button>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Go to the Calendar tab. If you don't have a calendar yet, you'll see an option to Create or Join. Tap Create, give your calendar a name (like "Our Family"), and pick a color. You can then invite family members by email so everyone can see and add appointments.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <button class="faq-question" onclick="toggle(this)">
      Can I invite family members to my calendar?

    </button>
